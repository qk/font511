# font511
5x11 bitmap font

Because I like Fixed Semi Condensed (aka 6x13), but wanted a smaller font, that was just as readable and unstylized but had the same character width/height ratio.

font511 doesn't leave vertical spacing between lines, so it's up to your terminal settings if you want to cram in as much text as possible (for programming) or slightly improve readability for continuous text by leaving 1px empty space between lines (for irc or latex).

To change linespace in URxvt add the following to your `~/.Xresources` file:

    URxvt.lineSpace: 0

# Installation

Download release, then proceed as follows:

## Windows

Right click font511.fon, click 'Install'.
